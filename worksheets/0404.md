## Topic: Recursion in two ways

For all the questions, **write down** the precondition, postcondition, purpose and produce of the procedure. **Identify** the base case and the recursive step of your procedure. While you are solving the problem, you should **not** refer to the templates for help.   
For the purpose of understanding, for what type of problems do we need to use recursion? When do you know you need/can use recursion to solve a problem? Besides recursion, is there a way to tackle the problems? 

### string-rotate
Write ```(string-rotate str num)```, which takes a string and an integer and rotates ```str``` forward by ```num``` places. For example, ```(string-rotate “I love CS” 3)``` should produce “ CSI love”.   
Can you come up with a recursive solution and a non-recursive solution? (hint: string-append and substring)

If you use remainder or quotient procedures for this question, try to define them by yourself here:

What if the input is a list and a integer, and you need to rotate the list? (hint: cons)

### list-reverse
Write ```(list-reverse lst)```, which takes a list and reverse it. For example, ```(list-reverse (list 1 3))``` should produce ```'(3 1)```
Write this procedure using direct/basic recursion. (hint: append)

Write this procedure using tail recursion. (hint: cons)

### Swap Elements in Pairs
Write a procedure ```(swap-pairs lst)``` which takes a list as a input, and swap every two adjacent nodes. For example, ```(swap-pairs (list 1 2 3 4))``` will produce ```'(2 1 4 3)```; ```(swap-pairs (list 1 2 3 4 5))``` will produce ```'(2 1 4 3 5)```. (hint: think about the input for the recursive step.)

### Pascal Triangle
![pascal triangle](https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/brioche/uploads/rVEbE9azzu-pascals-triangle-4.png?width=3000)  
Pascal triangle is one of the most interesting number patterns. Newton's bionomial coefficient could be derived from this triangle. A pascal triangle is showing here: observe the relationship between the horizontal layers and today we will just play around with this relationship.   
Write a procedure ```(next-layer lst)```: Given a list of integers representing one layer in the "pascal" triangle, produce a list of integers representing the top layer. For example: ```(prev-layer (list 1 3 3 1))``` will produce ```'(1 4 6 4 1)```; ```(prev-layer (list 2 2 7))``` will produce ```'(2 4 9 7)```;

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
_Extra fun:_ Assuming the input is valid, can you write ```(prev-list lst)```? For example ```(prev-list (list 1 3 5 3))``` will produce ```'(1 2 3)```.

### power
Write a procedure ```(my-power x n)```, which takes a real number ```x``` and a integer ```n``` and produce the x<sup>n</sup>. Remember that n can be a negative number. (hint: what is your base case here?)
