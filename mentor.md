# Question for mentors?  
I am happy to answer questions during class meetings and mentor sessions, but if you have questions not during the two occasions. Please refer to the following steps:  
1. Find the answer in the reading.  
    * Which reading should you go back to?
    * Is there a direct answer to your question in the reading?
2. Can you reach out to a evening tutor in the evenings?  
    * Our evening tutors are experienced computer science students. They get paid to help you and they want to support you. 
3. If not, google is your best friend.  
    * Which keyword should you use?
    * Is there a website that is particularly helpful to you? (e.g. [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/))
    * Have you tried to search for videos?
    * Is there a book for your reference? if yes, go the the learning center or the Kistle library
4. Then, as long as you don't violate the academic honesty rule, you are welcomed to ask your classmates for help!
5. Finally, write Sam, Fahmida, or us a email. We will get back to you during our working hours. 
    * You can find our email addresses using the directory in [Grinnell College website](https://www.grinnell.edu), or use DB if you have it in your phone. (p.s. As one of the developers of DB, I am open to comments!)

I know you can easily find us on facebook, etc. but you should not expect us to answer your questions through SNS especially not during our working hours.
