If you are thinking about grad schools, doing a [MAP](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/dean/map), [REU](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) or SURF(Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships) like research program may be your top choice to spend summer. As I know most of you are first years, so it is just the right time to start to prepare for the application or even just look for a program/project you are interested in.   

Here I want to post this google doc about suggestions on [how to write a good application](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1XtJq3BwSUxvijCoJaxXdCcf5tH-t_EsWC-GgC7KCx2A) written by someone who runs REU according to the writter himself/herself. 

If you are particularly interested in computer science research programs, you can come to talk to anyone of us, I am pretty sure that all of us know someone who has done that before, so you can talk to the participants to know more about it.
